🚀 Day 2: Basic Excel Functions for Data Analysis

💡 Why Excel first?
Excel is the foundation of data analysis. From data cleaning to visualization and reporting, mastering Excel will help me build a strong analytical mindset before diving into advanced tools.

✅ Excel functions for data analysis

Explored some fundamental Excel functions that every Data Analyst must know!

📊 Key Functions & Their Uses:

✅ SUM(range): Adds up all the values in a range. 

✅ AVERAGE(range): Calculates the mean of selected numbers. 

✅ COUNT(range): Counts the number of numeric values.

✅ COUNTA(range): Counts all non-empty cells (including text & numbers).

✅ MIN(range): Returns the smallest value in a range.

✅ MAX(range): Returns the largest value in a range.

✅ ROUND(value, decimals): Rounds a number to the specified decimal places.

📌 Applying the functions:
 
➡️ Total Sales: =SUM(B2:B6) → ₹50,500

➡️ Average Sales: =AVERAGE(B2:B6) → ₹10,100

➡️ Total Products Sold: =COUNTA(A2:A6) → 5

➡️ Highest Sale: =MAX(B2:B6) → ₹15,300

➡️ Lowest Sale: =MIN(B2:B6) → ₹5,000

➡️ Rounded Avg Sales (No Decimal): =ROUND(AVERAGE(B2:B6),0) → ₹10,100
